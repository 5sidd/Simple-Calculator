This is a simple calculator application which can add, subtract, multiply, and divide integers and decimals. Here are some important notes about this app. For one, if you press any operator without first inputting a number, then you will receive an error. Furthermore, if you click the operator twice in a row without inputting a number, then you will also receive an error. For example, if you input 8 + + 8, then you will receive an error. If you want to make a number negative, then first input the number as a positive number, and then click the negative button to turn it negative. For example, if I want to input -50 as a number, then I would first input 50, and then click the negative button to turn it negative. Additionally, once you press the equals button (=) you clear the expression preceding it and cannot perform any more operations on the output. For example, if I input 8 + 5 and then press the equals button, then 13 will be the output. If I tried to perform any more operations on this output, then I will receive an error. Additionally, only two numbers are operated at a time and outputted. For example, if I tried to input 10 + 10 / 2, then first 10 + 10 will be operated and 20 will be the output, and after this 20 will be divided by 2 and 10 will be the output. Lastly, the "Clear All" button deletes your entire inputted expression, and you will have to start over.
